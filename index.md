# Welcome to Science on the Screen 
### Supported by the Carnegie Institution for Science

Join us for free virtual screenings of popular movies! At Science on the Screen events, we invite you to watch movies from the comfort of your own home. Following each screening, we welcome you to join us for a live Q & A event with filmmakers and scientists where you can ask questions and get the inside scoop.
